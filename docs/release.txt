Xtend Screen v0.0.1 – Initial Release

Welcome to the first official release of Xtend Screen, your new go-to solution for turning any web-enabled device into a live secondary monitor. This inaugural version delivers the core functionality you need to start sharing and streaming application windows in real time:

Screen Sharing: Capture and broadcast individual application windows (or the entire desktop) with minimal latency.

Device Flexibility: Access your shared screens from any modern browser—smartphones, tablets, or another desktop.

Dual Interfaces: Choose between a native Qt GUI application or a lightweight FastAPI-powered web server.

Dynamic URLs: Each capture session generates a unique, shareable link for easy collaboration.

Cross-Platform Support: Built on Python and X11 (Linux), PyObjC (macOS), and PySide6 (Qt GUI), with Windows support coming soon.

This release establishes the foundation for future enhancements—improved performance, expanded platform coverage, and automated update delivery.

We welcome your feedback and contributions—please open issues or pull requests, and join us as we build the next generation of seamless, cross-device screen sharing.
